* wait-for-input

^^^ That was a directive (line began with '*'). 
Directives tell handy to do certain things. This wait-for-command
directive tells handy to listen to stdin for a command number after
it prints your handyfile

Handyfiles can contain anything you want, such as these comments. 
The only significant lines are those that start with '*' (we just saw this),
'-' (section heading), and '$' (actual commands). 

Here is our first section, 
$ command
- Carthage Commands

This will be printed as a section header when you use handy. 
Lets put some commands in this section. 

$ carthage-bootstrap --platform Mac --cache-builds

$ blah-blah --blah=blah -b -l -a -h
