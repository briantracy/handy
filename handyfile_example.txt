Example handyfile:

Everything in a handyfile is ignored except for lines starting with:

    1. '*' - A directive line. These specify flags that are
             passed to handy. 
    2. '-' - A heading line. Use these to group commands into sections.
    3. '$' - A command. Write out a command and it will be automatically
             ordered with the rest of your commands in the output.


Current Directive Support:
    Only one directive is currently supported '* wait-for-input'. This
tells handy to listen to stdin after it displays your handyfile for
a number. The nth command is then copied into your buffer.


# * wait-for-input

$ command 1
$ command 2
- Section Name
$ command 3
$ command 4
