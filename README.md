handy [<handyfile> [<copy paste program> [<command number>]]]

Never `history | grep ...` again!



`handy` is a command line utility that helps you keep track of a list of handy commands. 

As an example, how do I run a carthage update (or any other complicated command)

    $ <up><up><up><up><up> # crap, its not there
    $ history | grep "carthage"
      <tons of results>
      <have to mouse over and copy one>

Or you could simply
    
    $ handy
